# Transmit Morse code over a tin can telephone
This is the transmitter application for a hackathon project at MakeUofT 2019. Made with [Jonah](https://github.com/jonahs99) and [Zoie](https://github.com/orangeygeek).

One types a message into the app, and then it sends it in morse code over the computer's audio output so that it can be transmitted through a string between two cups. It is compatible with the [Transmitter App](https://github.com/jonahs99/string-mail-receiver).
